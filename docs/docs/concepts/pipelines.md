# Pipelines

A pipeline is the glue which ties all together. Each stage of a pipeline is a function which accepts iterables and returns iterables, to be consumed by the next stage.

A pipeline has methods to add operations to it, fork it and execute it.

For more information about pipelines, check out the [pipelines API](../api/modules/pipeline).
